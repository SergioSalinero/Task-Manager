# Description
The developed project offers a physical exercise platform based on PoseNet technology. Its function is to estimate the user's pose accurately and in real-time through the use of a recording device, allowing to show the correct performance of the exercise in question, avoiding physical discomfort and enhancing its evolution, as well as the collection of data and the calculation of statistics of interest to the user.

The platform offers services for building and planning physical exercise routines, visualizing statistics of the activity performed, and sharing routines in a public and organized way through independent training rooms, expanding the limits of its usefulness by connecting trainers and specialists directly with the user through training routines.
